# bf1-register
register microservice for TLop503/beaverf1

### !!! Security note:
This is not the safest way to run a registration service. I need something to meet a deadline and be minimumly viable, secure functionality comes later. This code comes with no warranty and should not be used outside of the BF1 project, at least for now. Here be dragons.

Request schema:

```json
{user:name,pass:word}
```
